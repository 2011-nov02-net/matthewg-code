reference types vs value types

    value types directly store their data in a variable (for things like integer values)
    reference types store a pointer to a memory address that holds the data (for things like objects)

garbage collection:
    provided by CLR in .NET
    scans unused reference types to free memory to be reallocated, avoiding a stack overflow
